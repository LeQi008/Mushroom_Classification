# Mushroom_Classification Repository!
## About
This is our Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Mushroom classification based on its edibility. We used the the dataset titled [Mushroom Edibility Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/mushroom-edibility-classification?resource=download&select=secondary_data.csv).

## Problem Definition
- We seek to understand the relationships between a mushroom's features and its edibility.
- Are we then able to create a reliable model to predict the edibility of a mushroom based of its features?

## Models Used
1. Naives Bayes 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree 
4. Support Vector Machines

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
- Cramer's V for nominal features
- Visualising probability distribution using ROC
- Concepts about Precision and Recall
- Naives Bayes Model
- Logistic Regression Model
- Support Vector Machines
- Feature Importance
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
- Collaborating using GitHub
